libMeanwhile is a library for connecting to a Lotus Sametime (tm)
community. It uses a protocol based in part off of the IMPP draft(*1),
and in part off of traces of TCP sessions from existing clients.

The libmwgaim plugin allows Gaim to connect to a Lotus Sametime (tm)
community using a compiled-in version of libMeanwhile.

See INSTALL for instructions on building and installing
