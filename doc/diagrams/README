Tools you'll need to re-create eps diagrams from dia files

	* bc		to do floating-point math in epsscale.sh
	* dia		to convert .dia figures into .eps
	* dvipdf
	* epsffit	used in epsscale.sh
	* grep
	* latex
	* latex2html
	* sed

All of these are standard in most Linux distributions.

While the primary content of the documentation is written in LaTeX,
the figures are created with Dia, and are embedded as eps files in the
tex source. The script epsscale.sh is used to uniformly scale down the
eps figures after dia converts them.
