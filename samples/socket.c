/**
   @file socket.c
   
   This file is a simple demonstration of using unix socket code to
   connect a mwSession to a sametime server and get it fully logged
   in.
   
   Here you'll find examples of:
    - opening a socket to the host
    - using the socket to feed data to the session
    - using a session handler to allow the session to write data to the
      socket
    - using a session handler to allow the session to close the socket
    - watching for error conditions on read/write
*/
