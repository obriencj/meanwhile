/* Life-cycle of an outgoing channel:

   1: mwChannel_new is called. If there is a channel in the outgoing
   collection in state NEW, then it is returned. Otherwise, a channel
   is allocated, assigned a unique outgoing id, marked as NEW, and
   returned.

   2: channel is set to INIT status (effectively earmarking it as in
   use).  fields on the channel can then be set as necessary to
   prepare it for creation.

   3: mwChannel_create is called. The channel is marked to WAIT status
   and a message is sent to the server. The channel is also marked as
   inactive as of that moment.

   4: the channel is accepted (step 5) or rejected (step 7)

   5: an accept message is received from the server, and the channel
   is marked as OPEN, and the inactive mark is removed. And messages
   in the in or out queues for that channel are processed. The channel
   is now ready to be used.

   6: data is sent and received over the channel

   7: the channel is closed either by receipt of a close message or by
   local action. If by local action, then a close message is sent to
   the server.  The channel is cleaned up, its queues dumped, and it
   is set to NEW status to await re-use.

   Life-cycle of an incoming channel:

   1: a channel create message is received. A channel is allocated and
   given an id matching the message. It is placed in status WAIT, and
   marked as inactive as of that moment. The service matching that
   channel is alerted of the incoming creation request.

   2: the service can either accept (step 3) or reject (step 5) the
   channel

   3: mwChannel_accept is called. The channel is marked as OPEN, and
   an accept message is sent to the server. And messages in the in or
   out queues for that channel are processed. The channel is now ready
   to be used.

   4: data is sent and received over the channel

   5: The channel is closed either by receipt of a close message or by
   local action. If by local action, then a close message is sent to
   the server.  The channel is cleaned up, its queues dumped, and it
   is deallocated. */
