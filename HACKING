3	Patch Submission

Patches should be submitted as github pull requests. One topic per
patch submission, eg: no bugfixes along with new features (unless they
are mutually inclusive).

Well before a pull request is even started, there should be a tracker
bug or rfe describing the effort for the pull request. For example if
a bug is discovered, the very first step should be to file a tracker
issue describing the bug. If you still want to move on to working to
fix the bug, then create a fork, work on your changes, and then submit
a pull request.
