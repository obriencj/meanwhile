3	Patch Submission

Patches must be submitted through the sf.net tracker. Patches must be
in the `diff -ud` format, and should be relative to the base sandbox
directory (the directory containing this file). One topic per patch
submission, eg: no bugfixes along with new features (unless they are
mutually inclusive).
